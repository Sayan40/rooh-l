## Project Overview
**Rooh** is a modern web application developed to deliver a seamless user experience focusing on performance and flexibility. Utilizing the latest web development technologies, the project aims to provide users with a clean interface, smooth navigation, and reliable functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: As the core framework, Next.js allows for server-side rendering and static site generation, enabling efficient loading times and improved SEO.
- **TypeScript**: Enhancing the robustness of the project, TypeScript introduces static typing to catch errors early during development, providing better code maintainability and readability.
- **Swiper**: For a responsive, customizable, and touch-friendly slider experience, Swiper is integrated into the project to enable smooth content display and carousel functionality.
- **Nodemailer**: To handle email functionality within the application, Nodemailer sends emails, enabling communication features like contact forms or automated notifications.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Server-Side Rendering**: With Next.js, the app achieves optimized performance, ensuring pages are rendered quickly and content is pre-fetched as needed.
- **Type-Safe Codebase**: By utilizing TypeScript, the codebase is more manageable and safer, reducing runtime errors and enhancing development speed.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Swiper allows for creating dynamic sliders and carousels, providing an engaging and responsive user interface.
- **Email Functionality**: Nodemailer ensures secure and reliable email delivery, supporting various use cases like user communication, feedback forms, and more.

## Project Goals
The goal of **Rooh** is to provide an interactive and responsive web platform that caters to user needs while ensuring the app is built with scalability and efficiency in mind. By combining Next.js, TypeScript, Swiper, and Nodemailer, the project leverages the strengths of these technologies to deliver a smooth and feature-rich experience.
